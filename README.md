# ðŸ›« Airport Project  

## ðŸ“Œ Overview  
The **Airport Project** is a data analytics and visualization project aimed at analyzing airport operations, performance metrics, and trends. It leverages SQL for querying structured data, Python for advanced analysis, and Power BI for interactive visualizations.  

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives  
- Retrieve and analyze airport-related data using SQL queries.  
- Perform data processing and transformations using Python.  
- Develop insightful visualizations to monitor airport operations.  
- Solve complex analytical challenges related to airport management.  

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset Sources  
The project uses structured airport data, which may include:  
- Flight schedules and delays  
- Passenger traffic statistics  
- Airline operations and performance metrics  
- Baggage handling and security check analytics  

## ðŸ”¹ Project Components  
### **SQL Queries**  
- **Normal Queries**: Standard SQL queries for retrieving airport-related data.  
- **Challenging Queries**: Advanced SQL queries for deeper analytical insights.  

### **Jupyter Notebook** (`AirportProject.ipynb`)  
- Data cleaning, processing, and exploratory analysis using Python.  

### **Power BI Dashboard** (`airportreport.pbix`)  
- Interactive visualizations for data-driven decision-making.  

## ðŸš€ Tech Stack  
- **SQL** (for data querying and manipulation)  
- **Python** (for data processing and analysis)  
- **Pandas & NumPy** (for data handling)  
- **Power BI** (for data visualization)  

## ðŸ”§ Usage  
1. Execute SQL queries to explore airport-related datasets.  
2. Use the Jupyter Notebook for additional data processing and analysis.  
3. Open the Power BI report to visualize key insights and trends.
